}
```

### Gradients
- **gradient-blue:** `linear-gradient(to right, #007AFF, #0056B3)` - Applied to hero section overlays for brand consistency, primary call-to-action buttons for added depth, and subtle background textures on key feature sections to convey innovation.

- **Secondary:** Predominantly used for light mode backgrounds, subtle section dividers, card backgrounds, and secondary textual information. Provides a clean, modern base.
- **Accent:** Reserved for primary calls-to-action, interactive elements, highlights, progress indicators, and subtle decorative touches. Commands attention and signifies action.

### Dark Mode
- **Approach:** A sophisticated, system-level dark mode detection with an accessible toggle for user preference. The dark mode is not merely an inversion but a carefully curated experience.
- **Adjustments:** Primary (#2D3A4B) becomes the dominant background, secondary (#F0F2F5) shifts to a lighter dark gray for contrast, accent (#007AFF) remains vibrant.

### Special Text Treatments
- **Hero Headline:** `font-extrabold tracking-tight uppercase text-primary-dark leading-none text-gradient-blue-text` - For the main, impactful headline in the hero section, utilizing a text gradient for a dynamic, modern feel.
- **Highlighted Quote:** `italic font-semibold text-primary border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 text-lg` - For customer testimonials or key brand statements, creating a visually distinct and authoritative block of text.
- **Interactive Link:** `relative text-accent font-medium after:content-[''] after:absolute after:bottom-[-2px] after:left-0 after:w-0 after:h-[2px] after:bg-accent after:transition-all after:duration-300 hover:after:w-full` - For inline links within body text or navigation items, providing a sophisticated, animated underline on hover.

## Visual Style

- **Aesthetic:** corporate
- **Border Radius:** none
- **Shadows:** none
- **Density:** comfortable
- **Image Style:** Blurred hero image, circular cropped service images. Overall low resolution and dated feel.

## Layout Concepts

- **Hero:** A full-bleed, high-resolution cinematic video loop (or dynamic image sequence) depicting abstract electrical currents, smart home tech in action, or skilled electricians at work with a sophisticated, branded color overlay. Overlay a massive, kinetic typography headline that animates into view, emphasizing key value propositions. The logo will be subtly integrated into the top-left navigation, not a central, blocky element, allowing the visual impact to dominate. A subtle, interactive element, like a glowing light switch icon, could invite interaction or lead to a key service.
- **Transitions:** Sections will flow with a narrative quality. Instead of hard breaks, we'll use smooth, theatrical reveals. This could involve a diagonal wipe transition, a subtle content mask animation, or a 'sticky' header that gradually shrinks as the user scrolls, revealing the next section with a gentle fade and scale. Backgrounds might subtly shift color or texture, hinting at the upcoming content.
- **Grid:** An asymmetric, modular grid that allows for dynamic compositions. Content blocks will often overlap, images might break out of their defined containers, and text elements could be positioned to create intentional tension and visual interest. This allows for a 'magazine-style' layout, using fluid columns that adapt elegantly across breakpoints, providing a sense of artful curation rather than rigid structure.
- **Whitespace:** Whitespace is a critical design element, not just empty space. We will use it generously and deliberately to create dramatic pauses, emphasize key content, and guide the user's eye through the narrative. This 'structured breathing room' helps to elevate the content, making the site feel premium, uncluttered, and sophisticated, allowing elements to truly stand out.
- **Scroll:** A story-driven, immersive scroll. Elements will animate into view with purpose (e.g., text sliding up, images revealing from a mask). Key sections might 'pin' briefly, allowing for interactive exploration or a horizontal scroll module for a project showcase or testimonials. Subtle parallax effects will add depth to background elements, and a progress indicator along the side will subtly show the user's journey through the page, enhancing engagement and providing a sense of progression.

## Animation Strategy

**Philosophy:** Animations will be purposeful, elegant, and performant, enhancing user understanding and delight without ever feeling gratuitous or slowing down the experience. They serve to guide, inform, and impress, contributing to a fluid and memorable journey.

- **Page Transitions:** A full-screen branded overlay (e.g., a subtle blue gradient wipe or a shape mask) that slides in and out, creating a seamless and branded transition between pages. Alternatively, a subtle cross-fade with a main content scale-up, keeping the user oriented.
- **Performance:** All animations will leverage CSS transforms (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, `opacity`) for hardware acceleration. We will minimize layout thrashing, utilize `will-change` property judiciously, and implement debounced scroll event listeners. Lazy loading for images and videos will be standard to ensure a smooth experience across all devices.

### Scroll Animations
- **Section enters viewport:** Text elements (headings, paragraphs) subtly fade in and slide up from the bottom. Images reveal from a masked state or apply a gentle parallax effect. Service cards might fan out or subtly zoom in. on h2, p, img, div.card
- **User scrolls past hero section:** The main navigation bar shrinks in height, changes background from transparent to a semi-transparent primary-dark, and becomes sticky at the top. on nav
- **Call-to-action button enters viewport:** Button performs a subtle 'pop' animation, scaling up slightly and adding a temporary shadow to draw attention. on button.cta

### Micro-Interactions
- **Buttons** on Hover: Subtle scale-up (1.05x), a gentle lift with a shadow increase, and a quick background gradient shift for primary buttons. Outline/ghost buttons will fill with accent color.
- **Cards** on Hover: Translate-y-[-5px] (slight upward lift), accompanied by an increase in shadow depth and a subtle border highlight, indicating interactivity.
- **Input Fields** on Focus: A smooth transition of the border color to accent and a subtle, glowing ring around the input field, clearly indicating active state.
- **Navigation Links** on Hover: A dynamic underline animation that draws from left to right, paired with a slight color shift to accent.

## Image Strategy

- **Treatment:** High-resolution, crisp photography that conveys professionalism and modern technology. Images will often be treated with a subtle, branded duotone overlay (using the accent color and a darker hue) or a consistent color filter for visual cohesion. Some images may be cropped into irregular, organic shapes or partially masked by text elements to enhance the artistic layout.
- **Placeholders:** During loading, images will display a blurred low-resolution version that smoothly transitions to the high-resolution image. Alternatively, a 'shimmer' effect with a `bg-gradient-gray` and `animate-pulse` class will be used, creating an elegant and branded loading state.

**Aspect Ratios:**
- description: A dynamic mix of aspect ratios will be employed to create visual interest. This includes full-bleed 16:9 for hero sections, artistic 4:3 or 3:2 for service features, and deliberate 1:1 for team members or detailed work examples. This variety prevents visual monotony and allows for creative compositions within the asymmetric grid.

## Logo Guidelines

- **Description:** A text-based logo 'WESTGATE ENTERPRISES, LLC' enclosed in a white rectangular box with a black border.
- **Style:** Utilitarian, blocky, text-only, with a strong border.
- **Colors:** #000000, #FFFFFF
- **Placements:** Centered in the top hero section, overlapping the blurred background image.

## Modernization Notes

### Generic gray color palette with no distinct accent color. → Implement a sophisticated dark blue-gray (#2D3A4B) as the primary, a clean light gray (#F0F2F5) as secondary, and a professional blue (#007AFF) as an accent. Introduce subtle gradients for depth.
*The current palette is dull and lacks modern appeal. A refined, slightly cool-toned palette with a clear accent will convey professionalism, trust, and a contemporary brand identity, improving visual hierarchy and user engagement.*

### Generic sans-serif typography (e.g., Arial or Helvetica) used inconsistently for headings and body. → Adopt Montserrat for headings (bold, all caps for emphasis) and Open Sans for body text (regular weight, appropriate line height).
*Modern, legible font pairing enhances readability and gives the brand a more contemporary and authoritative voice, establishing a clear visual hierarchy and improving the overall user experience.*

### Boxy design with sharp edges and no visual depth (no border-radius or shadows). → Apply a small border-radius (e.g., 4-8px) to interactive elements and cards, and introduce subtle shadows for depth and visual separation.
*Softens the interface, makes it more inviting and modern, and adds a premium feel without being overly playful. Shadows can help create a sense of hierarchy and focus.*

### Blurred, low-impact hero image that doesn't clearly communicate the service. → Utilize a high-resolution, professional hero image that clearly depicts the service (e.g., a skilled electrician at work) with a subtle, branded color overlay for consistency and text legibility.
*A strong, relevant hero image immediately communicates professionalism and expertise, engaging visitors more effectively and setting a professional tone for the website.*

### Logo is a basic text box with a black border, centrally placed and somewhat disconnected from the overall design. → Redesign the logo to be more integrated and modern, potentially incorporating a subtle logomark with the wordmark. Place it consistently in the top-left of the header for better brand recognition and navigation.
*A modern, well-integrated logo enhances brand recognition and professionalism, making the site feel more cohesive and polished. Top-left placement is standard for navigation.*

### The 'CONTACT US' button is a flat, gray rectangle that blends into the background. → Style the 'CONTACT US' button using the new accent color (#007AFF), with a subtle border-radius, and a clear hover effect (e.g., slight color change or lift with shadow).
*Improves the visibility and prominence of the primary call-to-action, making it more inviting and intuitive for users to interact with, thereby increasing conversion potential.*

## Design Inspiration

- Locomotive (for their scroll-triggered animations and fluid transitions)
- Red Collar (for their bold typography, asymmetric layouts, and deep visual storytelling)
- Aesthetique (for their elegant use of whitespace and sophisticated micro-interactions)
- The 'glassmorphism' trend for subtle UI elements over dynamic backgrounds, providing depth and modernity.
- The narrative scroll experience found on many Awwwards 'Site of the Day' winners, where content unfolds as a story.
- The use of kinetic typography and text gradients to add visual impact and innovation to headlines.
