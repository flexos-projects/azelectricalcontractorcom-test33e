Overlay a massive, kinetic typography headline that animates into view, emphasizing key value propositions. The logo will be subtly integrated into the top-left navigation, not a central, blocky element, allowing the visual impact to dominate. A subtle, interactive element, like a glowing light switch icon, could invite interaction or lead to a key service.",
      "sectionTransitions": "Sections will flow with a narrative quality. Instead of hard breaks, we'll use smooth, theatrical reveals. This could involve a diagonal wipe transition, a subtle content mask animation, or a 'sticky' header that gradually shrinks as the user scrolls, revealing the next section with a gentle fade and scale. Backgrounds might subtly shift color or texture, hinting at the upcoming content.",
      "gridStrategy": "An asymmetric, modular grid that allows for dynamic compositions. Content blocks will often overlap, images might break out of their defined containers, and text elements could be positioned to create intentional tension and visual interest. This allows for a 'magazine-style' layout, using fluid columns that adapt elegantly across breakpoints, providing a sense of artful curation rather than rigid structure.",
      "whitespacePhilosophy": "Whitespace is a critical design element, not just empty space. We will use it generously and deliberately to create dramatic pauses, emphasize key content, and guide the user's eye through the narrative. This 'structured breathing room' helps to elevate the content, making the site feel premium, uncluttered, and sophisticated, allowing elements to truly stand out.",
      "scrollExperience": "A story-driven, immersive scroll. Elements will animate into view with purpose (e.g., text sliding up, images revealing from a mask). Key sections might 'pin' briefly, allowing for interactive exploration or a horizontal scroll module for a project showcase or testimonials. Subtle parallax effects will add depth to background elements, and a progress indicator along the side will subtly show the user's journey through the page, enhancing engagement and providing a sense of progression."
